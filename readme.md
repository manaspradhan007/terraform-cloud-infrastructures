 # ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Repository 🚀

## Welcome!
This repository acts as the central hub for managing our cloud infrastructure across both Azure and AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Our aim is to provide a standardized, reusable, and efficient way to provision and manage cloud resources, leading to faster deployments and consistent environments.

Rapidly build cloud infra with this Terraform documentation. My 10 years of Azure, AWS, and Stackit experience proves its worth. It simplifies service provisioning, enabling quick developer support and successful deployments

## ✨ Features

Multi-Cloud Support: Centralized management for both Azure and AWS resources.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): All infrastructure is defined using Terraform, ensuring version control, repeatability, and immutability.
Modularity: Reusable Terraform modules for common cloud components (e.g., networking, compute, databases).
Resource Definitions: Dedicated resources sections for specific environment deployments using those modules.
Environment Agnostic: Easily deploy infrastructure across different environments (development, staging, production).
Scalability & Maintainability: Designed for growth, allowing easy expansion and updates to cloud environments.
Security Best Practices: Incorporates security by design, following cloud provider recommendations.
